# 👥 ExecScout — Executive & Board Intelligence Engine

**ExecScout** is an automated intelligence tool designed to scrape and extract company leadership (CEO, CTO, President, VPs, Board Members) along with their **mandatory LinkedIn profiles** and corporate contact details.

It is built with an **intelligent 3-tier quota conservation strategy** to respect SerpApi's free tier limit (**250 searches/month**).

---

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Direct Website Scraping (Zero API Cost)**:
   - Automatically crawls company homepages and uncovers leadership pages (`/about`, `/team`, `/leadership`, `/board`, `/company`).
   - Extracts names, executive designations, and **direct LinkedIn `/in/` links** embedded on the website without burning any search API quota.

2. **SerpApi Quota Guard (250 Searches/Month Conservation)**:
   - **Cache First**: Checks local `serp_cache.json` before querying Google. Rerunning against a company consumes 0 queries.
   - **Targeted Fallback**: Only issues a search query when an executive's LinkedIn profile is absent from the company website.
   - Single-query batch fallback for JS-rendered / dynamic sites (`site:linkedin.com/in "Company" (CEO OR CTO OR President)`).

3. **Contact Details & Email Pattern Mining**:
   - Extracts public contact emails and phone numbers from corporate pages.
   - Deduces corporate email formats (e.g. `{first}.{last}@{domain}`).

4. **Streamlit Interactive UI + Headless CLI**:
   - Interactive web dashboard with 1-click test chips for target companies.
   - Clickable LinkedIn links and category filters (CEO, CTO, President, VP, Board).
   - Export to **CSV** and **JSON**.
   - Standalone CLI runner (`run_scraper.py`).

## 📦 Setup & Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

### 2. (Optional) Set SerpApi Key
If you have a SerpApi key, set it as an environment variable or enter it directly into the Streamlit sidebar:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:SERPAPI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Linux / macOS
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
*(Note: ExecScout still extracts all direct website executives and LinkedIn profiles even without an API key!)*
